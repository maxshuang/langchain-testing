      "Based on the given context, there are a few mentions related to defining the term \"chemistry\":\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In 1730, Georg Ernst Stahl defined \"chemistry\" as \"the art of resolving mixed, compound, or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In 1837, Jean-Baptiste Dumas considered \"chemistry\" to refer to \"the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In 1947, the definition evolved to mean \"the science of substances: their structure, their properties, and the reactions that change them into other substances\" - a characterization accepted by Linus Pauling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. In 1998, the definition was broadened by Professor Raymond Chang to mean \"the study of matter and the changes it undergoes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the context mentions Georg Ernst Stahl, Jean-Baptiste Dumas, Linus Pauling, and Raymond Chang as people who tried to define what chemistry is over different time periods.\n",
      "Based on the given context, the only relevant information about equipment in a chemistry laboratory is the following sentence:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No other specific types of equipment are mentioned in the provided context.\n",
      "According to the context provided, the Austrian School (also known as the Vienna School or the Psychological School) is a school of economic thought that emphasizes the spontaneous organizing power of the price mechanism. Some key points about the Austrian School of Economics:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Austrians hold that the complexity of subjective human choices makes mathematical modelling of the evolving market extremely difficult.\n",
      "- They advocate a \"laissez faire\" approach to the economy with minimal government intervention.\n",
      "- Austrian School economists advocate strict enforcement of voluntary contractual agreements between economic agents.\n",
      "- They believe commercial transactions should be subject to the smallest possible imposition of forces, particularly government intervention.\n",
      "- The Austrian School derives its name from its predominantly Austrian founders and early supporters, including Carl Menger, Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk and Ludwig von Mises.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in essence, the Austrian School is an economic philosophy that emphasizes free market capitalism with little to no government interference, based on the view that human choices are too complex to model mathematically.\n",
      "The given context does not provide a direct answer to why people engage in sports. The passages discuss the definition of sport, the origin of the word \"sport\", and some organizations' views on broadening the definition of sport, but do not explain the motivations or reasons for people participating in sports activities.\n",
      "Unfortunately, none of the given context documents appear to contain information directly relevant to answering the question \"What is the effect of body chemistry on exercise?\". The documents discuss topics like the definition of sports, amyl alcohol, a glossary of medical terms, the Austrian school of economic thought, and general information about economics. There does not seem to be any mention of how body chemistry impacts exercise performance or recovery.\n"
